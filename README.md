# Instructions

Download the project, then run:

```
npm install
npm test
npm start
```

http://localhost:3000/

You'll then see a page with title "Anime List".

Only make changes in "/src/code-challenge". Some incomplete components and functions have been put in get started.

In "AnimeList.js" make a request to the URL in comments, then render the results, plus a text input to filter by names.

See "design.png" for the layout and design that we would like. But also, you should decide how the layout changes as the screen width is adjusted.

See "code-challenge.test.js" for detailed requirements and build the functionality to pass the tests.

## Advice

- Write code that you think represents clean and modern coding patterns
- This will only be tested on modern desktop browsers
- Don't worry if you can't make all the tests pass, just try to complete what you can

## Do not

- Edit any files outside of "/src/code-challenge"
- Add or remove dependencies or external resources
- Over-engineer a solution that does more than is necessary to complete the task

This should take just an hour or two, when you're ready, zip the contents of "/src/code-challenge" and email it to your recruitment contact.
